## Introduction

Writing an API project in Golang is Art, because there isn't any de-faco framework or standards to do something.
You have a planty of ways for doing things and at end you may figure out the way is not good or extensible as you think.

- Logging with [zap](https://github.com/uber-go/zap)
- Metrics with [otel](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go)
- Tracing with [otel](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go)
- Dependency Injection with [wire](https://github.com/google/wire)
